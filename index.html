        <p>Hello! My name is Carolina Aquino and I am from Brazil but I am currently living in San Antonio, Texas. I love staying 
            home but I also like to know new, interesting places. The last place my family and I visited was the McAllen temple,
            because it was recently built, we had the opportunity to see inside, my girls loved the experience, it was their first time 
            seeing so many parts of a temple.
        I like to sew, watch movies, listen to audiobooks, and learn interesting facts about nature with my daughters.</p>
        <p>My favorite temples are:</p>
        <ul class="box indent"> 
            <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/sao-paulo-brazil-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">
                SÃ£o Paulo Brazil Temple
            </a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/san-antonio-texas-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">

            </a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/salt-lake-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">
                Salt Lake Temple

        <p>I have been living in the state of Texas for a short time, but so far, I can say it is a nice place to live, with extremely hot weather during the summer and very welcoming people.</p>
